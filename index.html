            <p>Hey there! I'm Alex Latz - I'm a second-year CS major from Atlanta and I'm passionate about jumping
                head-first into
                programming problems (like this little demo)!<br><br>
                I'm not the best at front-end design, but I have
                experience working as a full-stack developer using Vue/PHP/SQL with Recz, an Atlanta home service
                provider startup. This past summer, I interned at Ansys with their Data Services team, working on a ML
                model and data collection pipelines.<br><br>
                In the past, I've volunteered with Trees Atlanta to help rejuvenate Atlanta's greenery
                and maintain our title as the "city in the forest!"" <br><br>
                In my free time, I love watching baseball (go cardinals!), gardening, and travel!<br><br>
                Click the navigation arrows next to my photo to see some of my travels this past year!
            </p>

        <div class="carousel-text">
            <p style="padding-top: 60px;">Last fall, I had the privilege of being part of the FYSA (first-year semester
                abroad) program.<br><br>
                This meant that my first semester at Tech was spent at GT Europe in Metz, France, where
                I had a blast traveling to 19 countries in 4 months!<br><br>
                In this photo, I'm standing in a bunker in Normandy, France, where the D-Day invasion took place.
                We had to take a crazy train itinerary to make this a day trip, and ended up pulling an all-nighter in
                Paris later that day!
            </p>

        <div class="carousel-text photo-desc">
            <p>Here's the view from a nine-hour hike I took in Zermatt, Switzerland for fall break!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-text photo-desc">
            <p>Later that week, I took a long train to Monaco, where I dressed up like James Bond with friends and went
                to the famous Monte Carlo casino! The harbor view was a little ridiculous.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-text photo-desc" style="padding-top: 100px;">
            <p>This spring break, I drove to New Orleans to explore the city and see its vibrant culture! I'm a
                big fan of music, so I had a blast exploring the city's music scene and record stores.<br><br>
                Thanks for clicking through my demo! I hope I can have the opportunity to contribute and grow as a
                programmer through web development with Bits of Good!
